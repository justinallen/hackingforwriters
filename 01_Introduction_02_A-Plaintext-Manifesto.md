#A Plaintext Manifesto 

Text is material: it is blocks and bricks, winding and snaking into structures of incredible denseness and complexity. Writers now inhabit a world where their own use of text to shape the world has a parallel in the mirror-world of digital code. 

What is the overlap of these uses of text, and where do these separate spheres of text-based magic align? 

In plaintext. 

In metadata.

In semantic code that meets structured content.  

The writer comfortable with text as code is less imprisoned by the world of digital objects. A text file is visible to a program, is text we can work with, process, transform, using any number of tools in any number of ways. Text locked in a Word file or a PDF is sealed, opaque, unreachable except for using a certain piece of software made by a certain company. Plaintext files are digital artifacts, transparent as sheets of glass. Word processor files are more like suitcases, each one requiring a key to access its contents.

This manifesto is an argument with two simple points - a recommendation and a strategy behind it:

1. Writers should compose in plaintext and shun the bloated pieces of machinery known as "Word Processors." This is not just minimalism. It has a lot of practical value. I also will argue that it also has an aesthetic value. 
2. By authoring their work in plaintext, and working in plaintext wherever possible, writers  position themselves to take control of their work technologically: they will be able to fluidly transform their work to different formats, rapidly publish it across platforms, and create semantically meaningful structures for presenting their work that match its intent. 

There are drawbacks to working in plaintext. The lack of paragraph indentation, the lack of features like "track changes" for collaborative editing, and so on. And yet, the more of us writers work in plaintext, composing our prose using plaintext, the more tools will appear to let us comfortably do everything we'd wish to in a rich text editor without confining our work to word processing software.

This handbook will not totally ignore the programs for creating and managing electronic documents that a writer may use. But it will encourage the use of plaintext and a plaintext mentality, and demonstrate the advantages of working with it.
