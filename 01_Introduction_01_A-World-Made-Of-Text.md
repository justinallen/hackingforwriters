#A World Made of Text

Writing in the 21st Century has already gone digital, and reading is rapidly following. The computer long ago conquered the typewriter. We increasingly read on screens, rather than on printed material; whether that's the glowing surface of a monitor, or the flat paperlike sheen of an e-ink reader.

This book takes it as a given that technology is how writers are working today, and b) assumes that if well-informed writers and readers are to take full control of the digital technology at their fingertips, they can enrich their world and extend their audiences in countless ways.

The theory behind the book's attitude, and the explanation for the inclusion of the word "hacking" in its title, is this, in a nutshell: use technology before it uses you. Or in the words of Douglas Rushkoff, "program or be programmed." Some writers and artists have turned to a romantic gaze towards the past as a response to quite accurately recognizing the new media landscape as one with troubling tendencies towards domination by large, corporate forces and simultaneously, a demonetization of creative work. Others have dove deep into technology without a second glance.

A "writer-hacker" does neither. The "hacking" that writers need to know need not have anything to do with breaking into networks, and does not necessarily even include any programming. Rather, it describes a strategy of self-reliance and when called on, defiance (of common practice, end-user agreements or accepted wisdom). It's a skeptical embrace of technology: one that takes questions of ownership, rights, utility, and free speech seriously, and works out a strategy and workflow based on these considerations. Technology is a battleground, and the winners will determine the future in ways that affect content creators deeply.

To hack is to tinker, customize, experiment, and push systems beyond their intended limits. It's important that writers today be at least familiar with the ethos of hacking and some of its tools, because the walled gardens of the corporate-owned internet, the software industry, and other forces must not be permitted to rule the writer's life, or the spread of ideas in the form of text, unchecked. To this end, this book will include opinion and viewpoints on digital technology in equal balance with practical reference information.

This book is for writers. It is front-loaded with non-technical material that gives an opinionated context for the intersection of writing and technology, while the rest aims to be a dense, deeply informative handbook of what writers should know about using digital technology themselves. It's directed at the general reader, while also aiming for rigor and accuracy. Wherever possible in the given scope, it includes immediately practical tips.

It begins with essays and perspectives about the forms, directions, tools, and strategies that writers are using in their work with text—how the medium is being used in innovative ways, and how it in turn is shaping what writers produce. 

From there, it follows into a discussion of topics ranging from document formatting, hypertext, content management systems, ebooks, cloud computing, data security, and  digital rights management. In each of these, the technical and practical information is leavened with perspectives on the history, politics, or aesthetics of the systems in question, in the service of providing context and aiding in comprehension.
 
Finally, the book concludes with just a little bit of "real" hacker material. A discussion of security, data mining, firewalls, tunneling, and encryption should provide some tips and pointers to deeper information for writers whose text-based productions are subject to censorship, or government or other intrusion. This information should be helpful for activists, journalists and writers in countries suffering from repressive governments and internet censorship—or writers interested in reaching across those borders. Due to brevity, it will be of limited utility, but help provide maximum clarity on this murky area.
 
My hope is that any writer will find a wealth of useful information here, navigating the shared labyrinth of text that constitutes the overlap of the writer's world and the hacker's world: regardless of whether you're just interested in improving your workflow or hoping to extend your reach to the internet, wondering about social media strategy or curious about e-books, interested in protecting your writings from intrusion or spreading them far and wide.
