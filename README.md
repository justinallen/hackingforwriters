Hacking for Writers
==============

A Digital Handbook for Writers, Journalists and Publishers 

[Work in Progress]

I've never publicly shared a book in progress before, and it feels a little weird (please excuse a typo-ridden disorganized mess). I've also never tried to write a technical book before. But I don't want this to be simply a how-to guide or manual, I want it to be about content and form as well as strategy and delivery - I want it to be a really unique resource. So if there's any type of book I might attempt that could benefit from plenty of early and public feedback, it's this one. Technology moves fast. My bias will be towards general principles, but still, you want to be up to date. 

As I go, this book may resemble my own personal notes as I try, as a writer / technologist, to work this stuff out for myself. As I will explore at length in the text, this is both an exciting and a difficult time to be a writer. We're all a little on our own trying to figure out the answers, because nobody really has them. And beyond that, no matter how technology for reading, writing, buying or selling books develops, every writer will still face the work of finding their voice and their audience, which is not exactly a technical problem, and which this book won't even try to answer.

Although I'm sharing this publicly, this is not an open source text; if I ever finish it, I hope I can sell copies and will not be granting permission for anyone else to do so. However, as I get into the technical side of things I will welcome suggestions for revision, and Github is as good a forum for that as any. Until this book is a bit more developed, no one will care, but the license for the digital edition will be the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode).

What this means, briefly, is that digital edition will be free in some format for personal and non-commercial use. I'm going to test my theory that print books have an intrinsic value even if the contents are freely available digitally: I've found this to be true as a consumer, since I'll often read a book on my Kindle and if I really like it, then buy a print copy to re-read, lend to friends, or just have sitting on the shelf as a reminder of the contents I ingested. 

Of course, this is all only important if I ever finish it. Feel free to get in touch or comment if you have suggestions, feedback, criticisms, corrections, ideas or - especially welcome - encouragement or some other kind of support.
