#Technology and Self-Publishing 


The Internet has toppled empires but new gatekeepers are rising to take their place. There's a lot of rhetoric about the liberating power of the Internet and the amazing wonderful freedom of communication it can enable. But there are many problems.

Google and other Internet giants like Amazon have taken tremendous amounts of business away from "big content" - newspapers, publishers and bookstores. These old guard establishments had their shortcomings, of course, but they also represented a traditionally reliable human network of infrastructure that supported writers as a whole. Payrolls full of hardworking editors, who nurtured the careers of fledgling writers, are gone.

The old, paper-based supply chain of publishing had many limitations, based as it was on a world of slower-travelling information. But it had solved, at least to a much better degree, the problem of monetizing content. The Internet is still a wild west frontier of mostly free content produced by a complicated blend of amateurs and professionals. The lines have completely blurred, wages have plummetted to rock-bottom, and anyone who can type has the same access to instantly publish their words as a veteran war correspondent. This leveling of the playing field is exciting, and holds tremendous potential for upstarts.

But a realistic assessment shows that privilege still holds its advantages. The deprofessionalization of journalism is underway, and Ivy League interns who can afford to work unpaid fill the social media streams, aggregating the also unpaid work of struggling writers who publish on the side as they string along adjunct work at a University or part-time gigs tutoring or bartending.  

The situation is unsustainable, because content producers do, in the end, need to have ways to support themselves. The arrival of walled gardens - the private content universes of iTunes, Netflix, and Amazon - was inevitable. And it is not always good news: the new kings of content do not necessarily see themselves as owing anything at all to the content creators. It's often up to the self-publisher to see after the editing, book design, marketing and promotion of their work, all of which are usually better left to someone other than the writer themselves.

It's up to the writer to make the best of this situation, and each writer has to figure out their own monetization strategy. How will you make your work put food on the table? It's a complicated question and there is no simple answer. You might not want to monetize too quickly. Building up skill and a body of work and a following all are essential, and you can do those by publishing free content. 

When you're ready to try and assign a value to your work, these are the options for doing it yourself. For the non-DIY, traditional publishing route, and how getting geeky about your process can help, see the Electronic Submissions chapter[link to come].

###Small Publishers

Why do I include small publishers among other self-publishing options? Because with a small publisher (depending on how small) you may still end up being largely on your own in marketing your writing, getting the word out about your book, etc. What is the point, then? It all depends on what the publisher can offer and what kind of deal you think you can get. The hole left by traditional publishers as they've consolidated and then been further hollowed out by the Internet is a large one. New, lean independent publishind houses like McSweeney's have found an opportunity to introduce new work. It might be that any help you can get is time you'll spend better by doing more writing, and less worrying about book designs and marketing emails. Any small publisher you're likely to work with isn't doing it for the money anyways; the publishing industry has always relied on narrow margins and people who did it because they cared. Full disclosure: I'm in the process of building my own small publishing operation.   

###Traditional Self-Publishing

What if you want a greater degree of control, and are working with a limited budget and need to make the absolute most of it? Traditional self-publishing, by which I mean working directly with a printer, or even printing the books yourself physically, as well as closely managing other aspects of the business such as your own e-commerce operation, offer another route.
